# Memory Card Matching Game

A fun and interactive matching card game built using ReactJS. The game features various themes such as Fruits, Tech, and Animals. It has different difficulty levels, real-time score tracking, and a timer. Players match pairs of cards, and when all pairs are matched, the game celebrates with confetti and sound effects.
